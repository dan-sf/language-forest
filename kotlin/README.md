Kotlin Language
===============

Kotlin is a nice language. It has a lot of solid features to enable
oop/functional/imperative programming styles. It does feel a little more heavy
weight due to the main backend being the JVM, and the fact that it relies heavily
on a build system and an IDE. There is a Kotlin compiler available but it seems
like the most common way to run the language is with a
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) + [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
combination.

## Installation

The most straight forward way to install Kotlin is by just installing Intellij.
The community edition can be
[installed](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for free. 

Once installed you can create a new Kotlin project with the Gradle build system.
Once the project is created you can update it using any editor/ide you want. I
prefer Vim for most of my editing. However, using Intellij along side Vim is
nice for specific tasks. Debugging in Intellij is much nicer than Vim, but, I
prefer most general editing to be done in Vim. Intellij just feels too heavy
handed when it comes to my workflow.

## Basics

Kotlin is a pretty easy language to learn. It mostly behaves as expected and
makes it easy to get things done.
